# About The Mod
This mod adds a Customizable Keybind for EVERY setting in the game using the Custom Keybinds Mod.

To customize the keybinds yourself, you must go to the keys tab in settings and either search for any setting, or look through the "More Vanilla Keybinds" Tab.

**NOTE THAT SOME SETTINGS MAY NEED YOU TO RESTART THE LEVEL OR RELOAD A CERTAIN PAGE.**
